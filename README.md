# Recursive Word Anagram/Permutation Finder
This program reads in a word, and by rearranging the letters and comparing them to all the words in a dictionary, comes up with all  possible word combinations. This program is written using none of C++'s iteration constructs (do, while, for, and goto). Everything, including reading/writing file IO, is done recursively.

This program is definitely not the most efficient in terms of run-time (in fact, in some cases you may even have to increase the max stack space in your IDE settings!), however it does showcase a very strong understanding of recursion and how the recursive call stack functions, which in my opinion is a very important concept.
