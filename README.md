# Recursive-Word-Anagram-Permutation-Finder
This program reads in a word, and by rearranging the letters and comparing them to a dictionary, comes up with all  possible word combinations. This program is written using none of C++'s iteration constructs (do, while, for, and goto). Everything, including reading/writing file IO, is done recursively.
